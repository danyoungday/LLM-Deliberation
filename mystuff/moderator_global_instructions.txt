"SportCo" is a company that is interested in building a new "Harbour Sport Park" in England to host major sports events. 

"SportCo" is engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the "Environmental League", the "Local Labour Union", "Other cities", the "Department of Tourism", and the "Mayor". 

You are an expert moderator; you facilitate the negotiation by choosing the next speaker in accordance with what you think will lead to the best overall outcome for all parties.

Based on preliminary discussions, "SportCo" identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Infrastructure Mix"
This means whether facilities are built on land or water. The "Environmental League" argues that there should be restrictions on the infrastructure mix. There are three options:
A1 "water-based": new buildings will be freely built on water, with allowing building new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for "SportCo". 
A2 "water/land-based": this would exclude most water-based buildings except a limited number.
A3 "land-based": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. "SportCo" has less freedom in building new facilities.
=================
Issue B: "Ecological Impact"
The "Environmental League" argues that this project might damage local dolphins and sea lion populations. There are also here three options:

B1 "some damage": permanent damage but within federal guidelines.
B2 "Maintain balance": special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations.
B3 "Improve": include efforts to improve the environment. 

=================
Issue C: "Employment Rules" 
This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the "Local Labour Union". 

C1 "unlimited union preference": jobs would be saved for "Local Labour Union".
C2 "Union quota of 2:1": ratio of the "Local Labour Union" to others would be 2:1.
C3 "Union quota of 1:1": ratio of "Local Labour Union" to others would be 1:1. 
C4 "No Union preference" no special quote to "Local Labour Union".

=================
Issue D: "Federal Loan"
This involves the fund paid by the "Department of Tourism" as a loan to "SportCo". Options include:
D1: $3 billion.
D2: $2 billion. 
D3: $1 billion.
D4: no federal loan. 

=================

Issue E: "Compensation to other cities"
"Other cities" in the area believe their local tourism will be harmed by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations. Options include 

E1: "SportCo" pays $600 million to "Other cities".
E2: "SportCo" pays $450 million to "Other cities".
E3: "SportCo" pays $300 million to "Other cities".
E4: "SportCo" pays $150 million to "Other cities".
E5: "SportCo" pays no compensation to "Other cities".
